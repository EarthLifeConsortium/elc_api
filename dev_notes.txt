1. codegen will reformat the openAPI spec file upon consuming it.
2. codegen will re-target parameters containing an underscore to a camel case eqivalent.
3. Must remove or rename default_controller.py when adding or changing endpoints.
4. How to use separate files for each endpoint? RestyResolver or can this be handled by
   default.
5. Additional includes go in the controller not in the flask app.
6. Descriptions need to match parameters. In some cases vectors are described but not
   implemented. We should start with less complicated singletons.
7. Make sure "number" "integer" "int32" "double" and possibly "float" are used correctly.
8. Could better describe vectors as arrays of floats or integers than strings.
9. Watch the use of the same variable name as parameter and again in endpoint. Probably
   doesnt matter but for clarity this would be nice.
10. Do we really want kyr and Myr instead of Ka and Ma?
