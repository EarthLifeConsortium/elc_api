``bbox=latitude_ll,longitude_ll,latitude_ur,longitude_ur``
    Geographic bounding box for constraining the response. Latitudes and longitudes are given in decimal degrees ranging from -90 to 90 for latitude (negative values denoting southern) and -180 to 180 for longitude (negative values denoting western). ``_ll`` indicates coordinates of the lower left corner of the polygon and ``_ur`` the upper right. This list must contain precisely four coordinates (two sets) and be ordered exactly as written above. Type: `float`
