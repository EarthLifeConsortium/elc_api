Project Deliverables
====================

Data retrieval
--------------
A core mission of the Earth Life Consortium is the development of an application programming interface (API) which will simultaneously query the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) and the Neotoma Paleoecology database. Resulting subqueries to these databases are processed and reformatted by the ELC API to provide the end user with comparable data objects. The goal of this composite API is to bridge the differences in time resolution and nature of holdings between the databases.

Other goals
-----------
**Extensibility**
    Establish harmonized Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Web services between Neotoma and PBDB, with capability for extension to other related databases.

**Data holdings**
    Fully incorporate six other databases into Neotoma, employing a common database structure and a distributed governance approach based on virtual constituent databases.

**Common vocabulary**
    Establish a common data interchange standard between these resources and contemporary biodiversity databases (e.g. BISON/GBIF, iDigBio) by adopting the Darwin Core format and further extending it for use with additional and richer paleobiological data elements.

**End-user tools**
    Build open-source analytical toolkits using R, the open-source scientific and statistical programming language, and create a clearinghouse for sharing analytical tools developed by the broader community.

**Advisory council**
    Establish a Paleobiology Data Advisory Council (PDAC) composed of scientists and information specialists from both the geosciences and biosciences.
